# Rutgers-Data101
These are the assignments that I completed during the Data101 course offered at Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences. During this course, I was gained lots of experience with R and learned the basics of critical Data Anaylsis. Through this course, I learned how to use R to generate plots, analyze critial patterns present in large and small datasets, and create accurate prediction using machine learning libraries like `rpart` and the built in `predict` function present in R based on a given linear regression model.

(Assignment descriptions will be updated at a later time.)
